const pricingFAQs = [
  { question: 'How much does house cleaning cost in NYC?', answer: 'Our standard rate is $3/lb when you provide supplies, $75/hr when we bring everything, and $100/hr for same-day emergency service. A typical studio takes 2–3 hours. We provide free custom quotes based on your home size and cleaning needs.' },
  { question: 'Do you charge a flat rate or hourly?', answer: 'We charge by the hour. The rate is the same regardless of service type or neighborhood — $3/lb with your supplies, $75/hr when we bring everything, $100/hr for same-day emergency service. No hidden fees, no surge pricing.' },
  { question: 'Is there a minimum charge?', answer: 'Our minimum is 2 hours per visit. Most apartments take 2–4 hours depending on size and condition.' },
  { question: 'Do I pay before or after the cleaning?', answer: 'You pay after the cleaning is complete, before the cleaner leaves. No deposits, no pre-charges, no money upfront.' },
  { question: 'What payment methods do you accept?', answer: 'We accept cash, credit card, debit card, Zelle (hi@washandfoldnyc.com), Venmo, and Apple Pay. You choose what works best for you.' },
  { question: 'Do you offer discounts for recurring cleanings?', answer: 'Our hourly rate stays the same for all cleanings. The savings with recurring service come from shorter cleaning times — a well-maintained home takes less time to clean each visit.' },
]

const serviceFAQs = [
  { question: 'What\'s included in a regular cleaning?', answer: 'Kitchen countertops, stovetop, and sink cleaning. Bathroom toilet, tub, and sink scrub. Dusting all surfaces. Vacuuming and mopping all floors. Bed making. Mirror polishing. Trash removal. Appliance exterior wipe-down. Light switches and door handles.' },
  { question: 'What\'s the difference between deep cleaning and regular cleaning?', answer: 'A deep cleaning covers everything in a regular cleaning plus: inside the oven and refrigerator, baseboard scrubbing, window sills and tracks, cabinet exteriors, light fixtures and ceiling fans, behind and under all furniture, air vents, and door frames. It\'s recommended for first-time clients or seasonal refreshes.' },
  { question: 'What does move-in/move-out cleaning include?', answer: 'We clean every inch of the empty space: inside all cabinets, drawers, and shelves. Inside the oven, fridge, and dishwasher. All closet interiors. Wall spot-cleaning and scuff removal. Window interiors. Baseboard scrubbing. All floors scrubbed and polished. Final walk-through inspection.' },
  { question: 'Do you clean offices and commercial spaces?', answer: 'Yes. We provide professional office cleaning for small offices, co-working spaces, medical offices, and retail spaces. Same rates, same quality. Desk and workstation wipe-down, common areas, restrooms, and kitchen/break room included.' },
  { question: 'Do you offer Airbnb turnover cleaning?', answer: 'Yes. We follow a strict checklist for short-term rental turnovers: strip and remake beds, amenity restocking check, photo-ready staging, full bathroom scrub, kitchen reset, and spot-check for damage. Fast turnovers between guests.' },
  { question: 'What cleaning products do you use?', answer: 'We use professional-grade, eco-friendly cleaning products that are safe for children, pets, and all surfaces. If you have specific product preferences or allergies, let us know and we\'ll accommodate.' },
]

const schedulingFAQs = [
  { question: 'How do I book a cleaning?', answer: 'Text or call (917) 970-6002. We typically schedule within 24–48 hours. Same-day availability for urgent requests.' },
  { question: 'Can I get the same cleaner each time?', answer: 'Yes. For recurring clients, we assign the same dedicated cleaner to your home so they learn your preferences and layout. Consistency is one of the things our clients value most.' },
  { question: 'Do you offer same-day cleaning?', answer: 'Yes. Call or text (917) 970-6002 and we\'ll dispatch a professional cleaner within hours. Same-day service is $100/hr.' },
  { question: 'How do I reschedule or cancel?', answer: 'First-time and one-time services cannot be cancelled or rescheduled once confirmed. Recurring services (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly) require 7 days notice to reschedule, and cancellations are only permitted if discontinuing the service entirely with 7 days notice. We don\'t take payment upfront — we hold your spot and turn away other clients, so late changes directly affect our team members who depend on this income.' },
  { question: 'What hours do you operate?', answer: 'Office hours are Monday through Saturday 7am to 7pm. Sales and booking inquiries are available 24/7 — call or text (917) 970-6002 anytime.' },
]

const trustFAQs = [
  { question: 'Are your cleaners licensed and insured?', answer: 'Yes. All of our cleaners are fully licensed, insured, and background-checked. We carry general liability insurance and bonding for your complete protection and peace of mind.' },
  { question: 'Do I need to be home during the cleaning?', answer: 'No. Many of our clients provide a key, lockbox code, or doorman access. If you prefer to be home, that\'s perfectly fine too.' },
  { question: 'What if I\'m not satisfied with the cleaning?', answer: 'We offer a satisfaction guarantee. If you\'re not happy with any part of the cleaning, contact us within 24 hours and we\'ll send a team back to address the issue at no extra charge.' },
  { question: 'Do you bring your own supplies?', answer: 'It\'s your choice. At $3/lb you provide the supplies. At $75/hr we bring everything — professional-grade cleaning products and all equipment needed. $100/hr for same-day emergency service, we bring everything.' },
  { question: 'Are there any contracts or commitments?', answer: 'No contracts. Stay because you\'re happy, not because you\'re locked in. Cancel recurring service anytime with 7 days notice.' },
  { question: 'What areas do you serve?', answer: 'We serve Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island (Great Neck, Manhasset, Port Washington, Garden City, Roslyn), and New Jersey (Hoboken, Jersey City, Weehawken, Edgewater). Same rates everywhere.' },
  { question: 'How long does a cleaning take?', answer: 'Regular cleaning: 2–4 hours. Deep cleaning: 2–4 hours. Move-in/out: 4–8 hours. Post-renovation: 5–10 hours. Time depends on home size and condition.' },
