  { question: 'What areas does Wash and Fold NYC serve?', answer: 'We serve all of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens — nearly two hundred neighborhoods in total. Every neighborhood gets the same three dollar per pound rate with free pickup and delivery. There are no distance surcharges, no zone fees, and no different pricing based on where you live. We cover the Upper East Side to Washington Heights, Williamsburg to Bay Ridge, and Astoria to Far Rockaway.' },
  { question: 'Is the price the same in every neighborhood?', answer: 'Yes. Three dollars per pound, thirty-nine dollar minimum, free pickup and delivery — the same in every neighborhood we serve. Whether you live in a luxury doorman building on Park Avenue or a walkup in Bushwick, the rate is identical. We do not charge more for farther locations or busier neighborhoods.' },
  { question: 'How do I know if you serve my building?', answer: 'If your building is in Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Queens, we almost certainly serve it. We pick up from doorman buildings, walkups, co-ops, condos, public housing, student dorms, and single-family homes. Text us your address and we will confirm immediately.' },
  { question: 'Do you serve the outer parts of Queens?', answer: 'Yes. We serve all of Queens including Flushing, Bayside, Jamaica, Richmond Hill, Ozone Park, Howard Beach, Far Rockaway, and every neighborhood in between. Same three dollar per pound rate with free pickup.' },
  { question: 'Are you expanding to the Bronx or Staten Island?', answer: 'Not currently, but we are evaluating expansion. If you are in the Bronx or Staten Island and want to be notified when we launch, text nine-one-seven, nine-seven-zero, six-zero-zero-two and we will add you to our waitlist.' },
  { question: 'How does pickup work in a walkup?', answer: 'We come directly to your apartment door on any floor. Leave your bag outside your door before your pickup window. Our driver walks up, grabs the bag, and texts you confirmation. On delivery, we bring it back to the same spot. No need to carry anything downstairs.' },
  { question: 'How does pickup work with a doorman?', answer: 'Leave your bag with the front desk. Our driver picks it up during your window and drops clean laundry back at the desk on delivery day. You get a text at both pickup and delivery. Zero coordination needed on your part.' },
  { question: 'Can I use different addresses for pickup and delivery?', answer: 'Yes. Some customers have us pick up from their office and deliver to their apartment, or vice versa. Just let us know both addresses when scheduling. Both must be in our Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Queens service area.' },
  { question: 'Do you serve commercial addresses?', answer: 'Yes. Our commercial laundry service is available at any business address in our coverage area. Restaurants, salons, gyms, offices, and Airbnb units all qualify. Commercial pricing ranges from one to two dollars per pound.' },
  { question: 'What if I move to a different neighborhood?', answer: 'Your service comes with you. Since we serve all three boroughs at the same rate, moving neighborhoods changes nothing about your pricing. Text us your new address and we update your pickup and delivery location. Your subscription and preferences transfer seamlessly.' },
