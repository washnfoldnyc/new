  { question: 'How much does the job pay?', answer: 'Pickup and delivery drivers earn twenty to twenty-two dollars per hour. Laundry attendants earn eighteen to twenty dollars per hour. Route managers earn twenty-two to twenty-six dollars per hour. All positions are paid weekly via direct deposit or Zelle. Tips from customers are one hundred percent yours and not deducted from your hourly rate.' },
  { question: 'What does the schedule look like?', answer: 'You set your own availability. We have morning routes, afternoon routes, and evening routes available seven days a week. Most drivers work four to five days per week with shifts ranging from four to eight hours. You tell us when you are available and we build your route around your schedule — not the other way around.' },
  { question: 'Do I need a car?', answer: 'For pickup and delivery drivers in Manhattan, a car is not required — many routes are walkable or use public transit with a folding cart. For Brooklyn and Queens routes, a car or access to a vehicle is strongly preferred since stops are more spread out. Laundry attendants work at our partner facilities and do not need a vehicle.' },
  { question: 'Do I need experience?', answer: 'No prior laundry industry experience is required for any position. We provide full training on our twelve-step process, route management, customer communication, and quality standards. What we look for is reliability, attention to detail, and a good attitude. If you show up on time and care about doing good work, we will teach you everything else.' },
  { question: 'How do I apply?', answer: 'Text nine-one-seven, nine-seven-zero, six-zero-zero-two with your name and the position you are interested in. Or visit washandfoldnyc.com/apply and fill out the application form. We review applications within forty-eight hours and schedule interviews the same week. Most new hires start working within one to two weeks of applying.' },
  { question: 'Is there room for growth?', answer: 'Yes. We are a growing company and promote from within. Drivers who demonstrate reliability and leadership are promoted to route managers. Route managers can advance to operations roles. Several of our current managers started as drivers. As we expand into new neighborhoods and boroughs, there will be more opportunities at every level.' },
  { question: 'What neighborhoods are you hiring in?', answer: 'We are currently hiring across all of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. You can choose routes in your own neighborhood or surrounding areas. We try to assign routes close to where you live to minimize commute time.' },
  { question: 'Are positions full-time or part-time?', answer: 'Both. We have full-time drivers working forty or more hours per week and part-time drivers working fifteen to twenty-five hours per week. You tell us how many hours you want and we will build a schedule that works. Many of our part-time drivers are students, parents, or people with other jobs who want flexible supplemental income.' },
