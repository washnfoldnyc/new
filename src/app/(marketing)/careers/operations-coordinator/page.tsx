    description: `<h2>Part-Time Operations Admin — Wash and Fold NYC — Remote</h2>
<p>Wash and Fold NYC is hiring a <strong>part-time operations coordinator</strong> to own the calendar, the cleaners, and the collections. You earn <strong>10% of every completed and paid job</strong> — paid per job via Zelle within minutes of completion, same as the cleaners. No base salary. No hourly rate. You earn when the business earns.</p>

<h3>Compensation</h3>
<p><strong>10% of total revenue per completed job, paid via Zelle within minutes.</strong> February: 36 jobs. March: 81 jobs, $17,000 revenue = $1,700 earned — 10% averaged out to about $40/hr. We are aiming for 100 services per week, which would be $80K/month in revenue and around $8,000/month for you. Average job is ~$210, so you earn ~$21 per job. The business is doubling — more jobs means more money, automatically.</p>

<h3>Time Commitment</h3>
<p>About 40 hours per month. Average 2-5 services per day. Each job takes minutes of your time — the platform handles automations. This is a perfect second job that could become full-time if you want it to.</p>

<h3>How Every Job Works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jobs are sold and added to the schedule. Cleaners are notified via text, email, and their team portal automatically.</li>
<li>Clients receive reminders at 7, 3, and 1 day before. Cleaners get a daily summary of all jobs the following day.</li>
<li>Cleaner arrives and checks in via the portal. You monitor check-ins in real time.</li>
<li>15 minutes before completion, cleaner hits the 15-min button. You are notified and reach out to the client to collect payment.</li>
<li>If client is happy, offer $10 off for a Google review and send the link.</li>
<li>Payment via Zelle. You get the confirmation email, thank the client, pay the cleaner, take your 10%, discuss next services.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Beyond the Daily Jobs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maintain great, steady communication with the owner — proactive updates, issues, and suggestions to improve processes</li>
<li>Handle client and cleaner issues — complaints, no-shows, scheduling conflicts, quality issues</li>
<li>Onboard new cleaners — check references, add to system, give portal access</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bilingual English and Spanish strongly preferred — our cleaning team is primarily Spanish-speaking</li>
<li>Responsive and reliable — clients and cleaners need quick answers, not next-day replies</li>
<li>Comfortable working from a phone and a dashboard</li>
<li>Available during business hours (8 AM–6 PM ET) to respond within 15 minutes</li>
<li>Honest and trustworthy with payment information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Employment Type</h3>
<p>This is a <strong>1099 independent contractor position</strong>. You are not an employee. You are paid per job, you set your own workflow, and you are responsible for your own taxes. You will receive a 1099-NEC at the end of the year.</p>

<h3>How to Apply</h3>
<p>Submit your application at <a href="https://www.washandfoldnyc.com/apply/operations-coordinator">washandfoldnyc.com/apply/operations-coordinator</a>. Include a photo and a 60-second selfie video introduction. If bilingual, speak in both English and Spanish.</p>`,

    question: 'How much will I actually earn?',
    questionEs: '¿Cuánto voy a ganar realmente?',
    answer: 'You earn 10% of every completed and paid job — paid per job via Zelle, just like the cleaners. The average job is about $210, so you earn roughly $21 per job. February we did 36 services. March we did 81 — that\'s $1,700. April target is 100+. The business is doubling. More jobs, more money, automatically.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many hours per day is this?',
    questionEs: '¿Cuántas horas al día es esto?',
    answer: 'About 40 hours per month — not per week. Average is 2-5 services per day. Each one takes minutes of your time — the platform sends reminders, cleaners check themselves in, Zelle confirmations come to your email. You\'re responding to texts and clicking buttons in a dashboard between your other activities. You need to be responsive during business hours, but responsive means 15 minutes, not glued to a screen.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a base salary or hourly rate?',
    questionEs: '¿Hay un salario base o pago por hora?',
    answer: 'No. You are paid per job — 10% of every completed and paid service, via Zelle, within minutes of completion. Same way the cleaners are paid. No base, no hourly. You get paid when jobs get done and money comes in. That means you have every incentive to keep the schedule full, prevent no-shows, and chase every payment. March that averaged out to about $40/hr. We\'re aiming for 100 services per week — at that volume this role pays around $8,000/month.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I do this alongside another job?',
    questionEs: '¿Puedo hacer esto junto con otro trabajo?',
    answer: 'Yes. That is exactly what this role is designed for. You need to be responsive during business hours (8 AM–6 PM ET) — meaning you can reply to a text within 15 minutes. If your other job allows you to check your phone and respond quickly, this works. Many dispatchers, VAs, and coordinators handle multiple clients or gigs at once.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What tools do I use?',
    questionEs: '¿Qué herramientas uso?',
    answer: 'A custom-built operations dashboard. It shows today\'s jobs, the cleaner schedule, client info, payment status, check-ins, and the 15-minute alerts — all in one place. You can run it from your phone or laptop. Cleaners have their own portal where they see their jobs, check in, check out, and hit the 15-minute button. Clients get automated reminders at 7, 3, and 1 day before. Everything is centralized — no spreadsheets, no guessing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to speak Spanish?',
    questionEs: '¿Necesito hablar español?',
    answer: 'Strongly preferred. Our cleaning team is primarily Spanish-speaking. Being able to text a cleaner naturally in Spanish — not through a translator — makes you significantly more effective and makes the cleaners\' lives easier. If you are bilingual, say so in your application video.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the three jobs exactly?',
    questionEs: '¿Cuáles son los tres trabajos exactamente?',
    answer: 'You own the calendar, the cleaners, and the collections. The full flow: jobs are scheduled, cleaners are notified automatically, you make sure they show up and check in. When the cleaner hits the 15-minute button, you reach out to the client to collect payment via Zelle. If the client is happy, you offer $10 off for a Google review. Then you pay the cleaner, take your 10%, and discuss next services if applicable. Between jobs, you handle any client or cleaner issues, onboard new cleaners, and keep Jeff updated.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I get paid?',
    questionEs: '¿Cómo me pagan?',
    answer: 'Per job, via Zelle, within minutes of the job completing — same as the cleaners. Client pays via Zelle, you get the email confirmation, you pay the cleaner their rate, and take your 10%. It happens in real time, not at the end of the week.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if the business grows?',
    questionEs: '¿Qué pasa si el negocio crece?',
    answer: 'You make more money. February was 36 jobs. March was 81. We\'re aiming for 100 services per week — that\'s $80K/month in revenue and $8,000/month for you. Yes, more jobs means more of your time, but the per-hour rate stays strong because the platform handles the automations. You don\'t renegotiate. You just earn more.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this a W-2 job or 1099?',
    questionEs: '¿Es un trabajo W-2 o 1099?',
    answer: 'This is a 1099 independent contractor position. You are not an employee — you are paid per job, you set your own workflow, and you are responsible for your own taxes. At the end of the year you will receive a 1099-NEC for your total earnings. This is the same arrangement as the cleaners.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I apply?',
    questionEs: '¿Cómo aplico?',
