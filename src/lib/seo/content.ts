    { question: 'Do I need to be home for pickup?', answer: 'No. Most customers leave their laundry bag with the doorman, at their front door, or in a designated spot. We text you when we pick up and when we deliver. You do not need to be present for either.' },

    { question: 'How far in advance do I need to schedule?', answer: 'Most pickups can be scheduled same-day or next-day. For same-day rush (+$20), schedule before 10am. For standard 24-48 hour turnaround, anytime works. Subscription customers have a standing weekly schedule.' },

    { question: 'Do you handle all fabric types?', answer: 'Yes. We sort every load by fabric type and wash each on the appropriate setting — delicates on gentle, heavy items on normal, towels on hot. Items that are dry-clean-only are flagged and set aside. We follow care labels on every garment.' },
    { question: 'How do you prevent lost items?', answer: 'Every order is tagged with your name and order number at pickup. Your laundry is processed in its own separate batch — it never mixes with anyone else. We do an inventory count at pickup and cross-check at delivery. Lost items are extremely rare.' },
    { question: 'Do you fold everything?', answer: 'Yes, every single item is hand-folded by a trained professional. Shirts are folded flat, pants are creased, towels are stacked, socks are paired, and everything is organized by garment type. When you open your bag, it is ready to put directly into drawers.' },
    { question: 'What happens if it rains on delivery day?', answer: 'Your laundry is packaged in sealed bags that protect against weather. If conditions are severe, we will coordinate with you to reschedule or find a safe delivery location like a lobby or doorman desk.' },
