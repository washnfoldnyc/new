A typical studio deep clean runs $196–$260 (4–5 hours). A 2-bedroom is usually $260–$390 (4–6 hours). A 3-bedroom can be $325–$520 (5–8 hours).

      { question: 'Should I get a deep clean before starting weekly service?', answer: 'Yes, absolutely. We always recommend a deep clean first. It establishes a clean baseline so your recurring weekly or bi-weekly cleanings are faster and more effective. After the deep clean, maintenance cleanings typically take just 2–3 hours.' },
      { question: 'Do I need to be home during the deep cleaning?', answer: 'No. Many clients leave a key, provide a door code, or arrange access through their doorman. You\'re welcome to be home or out — whatever is most comfortable for you.' },

      { question: 'How often should I get a deep cleaning?', answer: 'If you have recurring weekly or bi-weekly service, you may never need another deep clean. Without recurring service, we recommend a deep clean every 3–6 months to prevent buildup. Seasonal deep cleans in spring and fall are especially popular with NYC apartment dwellers.' },
      { question: 'Is deep cleaning worth it for a small studio?', answer: 'Yes. Studios have compact kitchens and bathrooms that accumulate grease, soap scum, and dust quickly. A 3–4 hour deep clean completely resets the space. Most studio deep cleans cost $147–$260 — less than a dinner out.' },
      { question: 'What products do you use for deep cleaning?', answer: 'At $75/hr we bring professional-grade degreasers, bathroom cleaners, glass cleaner, microfiber systems, and a commercial vacuum. At $59/hr you provide your own products. We\'re happy to use eco-friendly or hypoallergenic products — just let us know.' },

      { question: 'Can we customize the cleaning scope?', answer: 'Absolutely. Every office has different priorities. If your kitchen needs daily attention but desks only need weekly wiping, we\'ll adjust. We build a custom checklist based on your space and team\'s needs.' },
      { question: 'Do you provide cleaning supplies for offices?', answer: 'At $75/hr we bring all cleaning products and equipment. At $59/hr you provide supplies. For office clients, we recommend keeping a supply closet with basic products, trash bags, and paper goods — we\'ll handle the rest.' },

export function commonServiceFAQs(service: Service): { question: string; answer: string }[] {
  return [
    { question: 'Are your cleaners background-checked?', answer: 'Yes. Every cleaner on our team undergoes a comprehensive background check before their first assignment. We also carry general liability insurance and bonding for your protection. You can trust that the person entering your home has been fully vetted.' },
    { question: 'Do I need to be home during the cleaning?', answer: 'No. Many clients leave a key, provide a door code, or arrange access through their doorman or building management. You\'re welcome to be home or away — whatever is most comfortable. We\'ll text you when we arrive and when we\'re done.' },
    { question: 'How do I book a cleaning?', answer: 'Text or call (212) 202-8400. Tell us your address, preferred date, and any special requests. We\'ll confirm your appointment and match you with a cleaner, usually within the hour.' },
    { question: 'What areas do you serve?', answer: 'We serve all of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island (North Shore), and northern New Jersey (Hudson County). Same rates everywhere — no travel surcharges regardless of location.' },
    { question: 'Do I pay before or after the cleaning?', answer: 'After. We never charge upfront or take deposits. You pay only after the cleaning is complete, before the cleaner leaves. We accept cash, Venmo, Zelle (hi@thenycmaid.com), and credit card.' },
    { question: 'What if I\'m not satisfied with the cleaning?', answer: 'Let us know within 24 hours and we\'ll send a cleaner back to address any issues at no additional cost. We stand behind our work — your satisfaction is non-negotiable.' },
    { question: 'Do you bring your own cleaning supplies?', answer: 'At $75/hr, yes — we bring professional-grade products, microfiber systems, and a commercial vacuum. At $59/hr, you provide your own supplies. Either way, we\'re happy to use specific products you prefer (eco-friendly, hypoallergenic, etc.).' },
    { question: 'Can I request a specific cleaner?', answer: 'For recurring services, we automatically assign the same cleaner to your home every visit. For one-time bookings, we match you with the best available cleaner for your area and service type.' },
    { question: 'How far in advance do I need to book?', answer: 'We recommend booking 3–5 days ahead for the best availability. For same-day service, text us as early as possible — morning requests before 10am have the best chance of afternoon availability.' },
    { question: `Is ${service.name.toLowerCase()} available on weekends?`, answer: 'We offer service Monday through Friday 8am–6pm and Saturday 9am–4pm. Saturday slots fill up fast, so book early if you prefer weekend service. We do not offer Sunday service.' },
    { question: 'What payment methods do you accept?', answer: 'We accept cash, Venmo, Zelle (hi@thenycmaid.com), and credit card (via Stripe). Payment is collected after the cleaning is complete, before the cleaner leaves. No deposits, no pre-authorization holds.' },
    { question: 'Are you licensed and insured?', answer: 'Yes. The NYC Maid is a fully licensed cleaning company with general liability insurance and bonding. Every cleaner is covered while working in your home. We can provide proof of insurance upon request.' },
    { question: 'Do you offer eco-friendly or green cleaning?', answer: 'Yes. If you prefer eco-friendly, plant-based, or hypoallergenic products, just let us know when booking. At $75/hr we can bring green products; at $59/hr you provide your preferred products and we\'ll use them.' },
    { question: `Can I combine ${service.name.toLowerCase()} with other services?`, answer: `Absolutely. Many clients combine services — for example, a deep clean followed by weekly maintenance, or a move-out clean with post-construction cleanup. Let us know what you need and we'll create a custom plan.` },
    { question: 'What if I need to cancel or reschedule?', answer: 'First-time and one-time services cannot be cancelled or rescheduled once confirmed. Recurring services require 7 days notice to reschedule, and cancellations are only permitted if discontinuing the service entirely with 7 days notice. We don\'t take payment upfront — we hold your spot on our busy schedule, turning away other clients. Late changes directly affect our team members who depend on this income.' },
    { question: 'Do you clean apartments, houses, or both?', answer: 'Both. We clean apartments (studios through 4+ bedrooms), townhouses, brownstones, single-family homes, lofts, and penthouses. The hourly rate is the same regardless of home type.' },
    { question: 'How do you handle pets during cleaning?', answer: 'We\'re pet-friendly. If you have pets, let us know when booking so we can match you with a pet-comfortable cleaner. We ask that aggressive animals be secured in a separate room during the cleaning for everyone\'s safety.' },
    { question: 'Do you offer gift certificates?', answer: 'Yes — cleaning makes a great gift. Text us at (212) 202-8400 to purchase a gift certificate in any amount. We\'ll send a digital certificate that the recipient can redeem for any service.' },
    { question: 'What happens if something is damaged during cleaning?', answer: 'We carry general liability insurance specifically for this reason. If a cleaner accidentally damages something in your home, report it within 24 hours and we\'ll work with you to resolve it through our insurance coverage.' },
    { question: 'Do you have a referral program?', answer: 'Yes. Refer a friend and earn money every time they book a cleaning — not just the first time. Visit thenycmaid.com/referral or text us for details. It\'s one of the most generous referral programs in NYC cleaning.' },
